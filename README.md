Image Super Resolution
Image Super Resolution (SR), a crucial process in many image processing applications, aims to reconstruct a high-resolution (HR) image from a low-resolution (LR) counterpart.Deep learning-based techniques have demonstrated encouraging results recently; of them, Residual Channel interest Networks (RCANs) have drawn a lot of interest because of their exceptional performance. We present a new method for Image Super Resolution with RCAN architecture in this study. Using residual connections and channel attention methods, our approach takes use of RCANs' multi-scale feature learning capabilities to capture fine details while maintaining global structures. Comprehensive tests on benchmark datasets show that our suggested approach outperforms the most advanced SR techniques in terms of quantitative metrics and visual quality evaluation. Moreover, qualitative analysis and ablation experiments verify the efficacy of every element in our network architecture. Overall, with notable gains in fidelity and perceived quality, our method offers a potential option for real-world image enhancing challenges. The study presented in this article investigates the deep channel attention mechanisms in residual channel attention layers, which can be applied to the div2k image dataset to achieve state-of-the-art results in the image super resolution task.
